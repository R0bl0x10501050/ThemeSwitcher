## Semi-Warning

*This **should** not affect you:*

I've been experiencing a few bugs with the plugin Setting API and on multiple occasions has it wiped my **local plugin** storage. I do not believe this affects anyone who downloads it from the Roblox website, but I may be wrong. I would recommend keeping a backup of your themes *just* in case.
